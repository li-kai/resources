# CS2105 Week 10
## Haskell
Things that make Haskell special
- Laziness
- List Comprehension
- Monads
- Type Classes
### Lazy Evaluation
All data constructs and functions are lazy.
#### Infinite data structures
Using lazy evaluation alllows us to define infinite data sturctures.
They can be accessed in a finite way using functions.

> Non-termination / Infinite loop can still arise if we try to access all elements



### Type Classes
Advantage, equality between types are easy except for functions. Using type classes allows ability to do so.

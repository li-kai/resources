## Unsupervised learning

No understanding of what is what, no "telling" the machine that it is unsupervised learning.

Example, clustering algorithm learn by themselves to find the best closely fit clusters by distance x.

## Reinforcement learning

Instead of determining the correct output, we determine a policy for the situation, and we set an reinforcement agent (feedback, supervisor) to continuously improve towards this policy in the long run.

## Bayesian probability

Maximum a Posteriori Hypothesis

## K nearest neighbour

CIFAR10 training set, with 50k training and 10k test image.

Based on a training set -> (black box) -> output

### Attempt 1

L! distance = sum of (absolute distance between two images)
Training = O(1)
Predict = O(n)

# OOP

## Polymorphism
Different types of objects are
treated as a single general type, but yet each type of object exhibits a different kind of behavior.

E.g.
The loop at line 5 in the below code treats `Admin` and `Academic` objects as a single type called `Staff` and still the result of the adjust `MySalary` differs based on whether `s` is an `Academic` object or an `Admin` object.
```Java
ArrayList<Staff> staff = new ArrayList<Staff>(); //line 1
staff.add(new Admin(“Sam”)); //line 2
staff.add(new Academic(“Dilbert”)); //line 3
staff.add(new Admin(“Mui Kiat”)); //line 4
for (Staff s: staff) { //line 5
    s.adjustMySalary();
}
```


### Operation overriding
Operation overloading arises when there are multiple operations with the same name but
different type signatures.

E.g.
```Java
class Account {
    Account () {}

    Account (String name) {} // overloaded
}
```

SLAP: Single Level of Abstraction Per method

Refactoring: Improving the program's internal structure without modifying its external behaviour. Fixing bugs is not refractoring, and we must do regression testing after each change.

Revision control: The process of managing multiple versions of a code base.

Centralised Revision Control System (CRCS): a central remote repository shared by the team.

Distributed Revision Control System (DRCS): Every team member has his or her own remote repository in addition to their own local repository.

## UML Class Diagrams
UML class diagrams describe the structure but not the behaviour of an object.

### Visibility
The visibility of attributes and operations is used to indicate the level access a lot for each attribute or operation.

`+` public
`-` private
`#` protected
`~` package

### Associations
As objects work with one another, collaborations are used to represent connections or associations.
An association link denotes a *permanent* or *semipermanent* structural link between the objects.

### Composition
A composition is an association that represents a strong “whole-part” relationship. When the
“whole” is destroyed, “parts” are destroyed too. UML uses a solid diamond symbol to denote
composition.

### Aggregation
Aggregation represents a “container-contained” relationship. It is a weaker relationship than
composition. In UML, a hollow diamond is used to indicate an aggregation.

### Dependencies
Temporary contact between objects are dependencies instead. These are denoted with a dashed line.

### Operations
The ‘Operations’ compartment (or even both ‘Attributes’ and ‘Operations’ compartments) may be omitted if such details are not important.

#### Roles
'Role' labels are optionally used to indicate the role played by the classes in the relationship.
![role labels](roleLabels.png)

'Association' labels are used to describe the association. The arrow indicates the direction to be read.
![association labels](associationLabels.png)

Multiplicity is the number of objects that participate in the association.
`0..1` optional, can 0 or 1 objects
`1` compulsory, must always be linked to one object
`*` can be linked to 0 or more objects
`n..m` must be n to m inclusive
![multiplicity](multiplicity.png)

#### Navigability
Navigability (denoted with an arrowhead in the association link) indicates whether a class is aware of the other class (i.e. holds a reference to the other class).

## Object diagrams
An object diagram shows an object structure at a given point of time while a class diagram represents the general situation. Object names are underlined. Class-level attributes and variables are also underlined.

# Principles of Class Design

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
If a class has more than one responsibility, then the responsibilities become coupled. Changes to one responsibility may impair or inhibit the class’ ability to meet the others.

## Open Closed Principle (OCP)
Entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification (no touching at all).
You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.
Therefore, one must have insight to design classes such that they can be easily extended.

E.g. Instead of calculating area for the Shape, AreaCalculator should take in Shape classes that implement the `area` function.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

This goes together with Open Close Principle.

E.g. Instead of finding the type of shape and then calculating the area for that type, AreaCalculator should be agnositic of the subtypes of `Shape`.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.

When a client depends upon a class that contains interfaces that the client does not use, but that other clients do use, then that client will be affected by the changes that those other clients force upon the class. We would like to avoid such couplings where possible, and so we want to separate the interfaces where possible.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

A high level component should not depend on low level components.

> High level: Java is high level compared to byte code.

E.g. `Copy` class should not depend on `KeyboardReader` and `PrinterWriter` but instead on `AbstractReader` and `AbstractWriter` so new copy functionality can be introduced.

## Encapsulation
It packages data and related functions together into one entity. The data is hidden from the outside world and are only assessible using functions.

## Exception
An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts
the normal flow of the program's instructions.

## Assertion
Different from an exception, it is to prevent programmer mistakes instead of user mistakes. Assertions should be used to check something that should never happen, while an exception should be used to check something that might happen.

E.g.
```Java
switch(suit) {
  case Suit.CLUBS:
  case Suit.DIAMONDS:
  case Suit.HEARTS:
  case Suit.SPADES:
    ...
  default:
    throw new AssertionError(suit);
}
```

# Testing

### Scipted testing and Exploratory testing
Scripted testing is to first write a set of test cases based on the specification, performing the test cases and reporting any failures to the developers.

Exploratory testing is the process of devising new test cases based on the result of past test cases. (Aliases: reactive testing, error guessing technique, attack-based testing, and bug hunting)

Exploratory testing depends on the tester's prior experience and intuition. It is not a secure way of testing.

Scripted testing is more systematic and are more likely to discover the bug.

#### Regression testing
Testing to prevent regressions in functionality.

## Developer testing
System testing is to have the system built in its entirety before testing the system as a whole. Developer testing is early testing while system is still under development.

## Testing your own code
Advantages:
- Can be done early (the earlier we find a bug, the cheaper it is to fix).
- Can be done at lower levels, for examples, at operation and class level (testers usually test the system at UI level).
- It is possible to do more thorough testing since developers know the expected external behavior as well as the internal structure of the component.
- It forces developers to take responsibility for their own work (they cannot claim that “testing is the job of the testers”).
Disadvantages:
- Developer may unconsciously test only situations that he knows to work (i.e. test it too
“gently”).
- Developer may be blind to his own mistakes (if he did not consider a certain
combination of input while writing code, he is likely to miss it again during testing).
- Developer may have misunderstood what the SUT is supposed to do in the first place.
- Developer may lack the testing expertise.

# What makes a good design

## Coupling
Coupling is a measure of the degree of dependence between components, classes, methods, etc.

Low coupling indicates that a component is less dependent on other components. In the case of
high-coupling (i.e. relatively high dependency), a change in one component may require changes
in other coupled components. Therefore, one should strive to achieve a low-coupled design.

## Cohesion
Cohesion is a measure of how strongly-related and focused the various responsibilities of a
component are. A highly-cohesive component keeps related functionalities together while
keeping out all other unrelated things. One should strive for high cohesion to facilitate code maintenance and reuse.

## Defensive Programming
A defensive programmer codes under the assumption of Murphy's Law. Therefore, a defensive programmer proactively tries to eliminate any room for things to go wrong.

### Relational Integrity
Enforcing 1-to-1 associations by checking and enforcing the 1-to-1 mapping.

This is only applicable to diagrams with bidirectional links. (Two unidirectional ones are not RI)

# User diagram
E.g.
System: EZ-Link machine (those found at MRTs)

Use case: UC2 top-up EZ-Link card

Actor: EZ-Link card user

Preconditions: All hardware in working order.

Guarantees: MSS -> the card will be topped-up.

MSS:
1. User places the card on the reader.

2. System displays card details and prompts for desired action.

3. User selects top-up.

4. System requests for top-up details (amount, payment option, receipt required?).

5. User enters details.

6. System processes cash payment (UC02) or NETS payment (UC03).

7. System updates the card value.

8. System indicates transaction as completed.

9. If requested in step 5, system prints receipt.

10. User removes the card.

Use case ends.

Extensions:
- *a. User removed card or other hardware error detected.
- *a1. System indicates the transaction has been aborted.

Use case ends.

# Integrating Software Components

## Big-bang integration
In the big-bang integration approach, all components are integrated at the same time. This
approach is not recommended since it will uncover too many problems at the same time which
could make debugging and bug-fixing more complex than when problems are uncovered more
gradually.

Arguments for:
- It is relatively simple; even big-bang can succeed.
- Project duration is short; there is not enough time to integrate in steps.
- The system is non-critical, non-production (demo only); the cost of integration issues is
relatively small.

Arguments against:
- Inexperienced developers; big-bang more likely to fail
- Too many problems may be discovered too late. Submission deadline (fixed) can be
missed.
- Team members have not worked together before; increases the probability of
integration problems.

## Incremental integration
For non-trivial integration efforts, the following three incremental integration approaches are
more suitable.

### Top-down integration
In top-down integration, higher-level components are integrated before bringing in the lower-level components.

Advantage of this approach is that higher-level problems can be discovered early.

Disadvantage is that this requires the use of dummy or skeletal components (i.e. stubs) in place of lower level components until the real lower-level components are integrated to the system. Otherwise, higher level components cannot function as they depend on lower level ones.

### Bottom-up integration
This is the reverse of top-down integration. Advantages and disadvantages are simply the reverse of those of the top-down approach.

### Sandwich integration
This is a mix of the top-down and the bottom-up approaches. The idea is to do both top-down and bottom-up so as to “meet up” in the middle.

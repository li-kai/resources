# Carbon is a one-sided fraud, we should love it instead!

## Carbon is necessary in life, and we cannot achieve a zero-carbon environment

## Actual: Carbon is too simplistic, because it is a key element of living substance (inductive)

### Evidence

- "It is all very one-sided"
- "Therefore carbon is the key element of living substance"
- "finding carbon, the source of life on Earth"

## Carbon is not harmful but useful, even CO2

## Actual: Carbon has multiple applications (inductive)

### Evidence

- Carbon is used for various applications in our life
- Carbon can be used as material, batteries and more
- "it uses modular, scalable converter ponds to turn concentrated industrial waste CO2, non-potable water and sunlight directly into different fuels"

- It can be used in materials construction
- It can be used in electronics
- It can be used in solar cells

## Actual: CO2 has many potential applications (inductive)

### Evidence

- Emissions from power plants can be combined with other substances to make useful products
- Industrial waste can be made into fuel

## We should embrace carbon, and build a better world from it

## Actual: We need to emphaise and harness the beneficial properties of carbon (inductive)

### Evidence

- "the world could really do with a new carbon infrastructure"
- "On the whole, then, the world is still in a prehistoric period in relation to carbon. It has yet fully to realise the potential of this most remarkable of atoms."

- Hyperbole and hyprocrisy even those who seek to harness CO2
- Industrial scale recycling of CO2 illustrates its value
- Too little research has been done on CO2 for decards
- Investment into carbon infrastructure is currently insufficient


## How to write an argument

- State key argument in full
- State premises
- State evidence

- Access premise's logic, is it cogent?
- Are the facts and evidence sufficient?
- Is this relevant or correct? Cross reference to check.

# Fallacies

## Purpose

Used to disprove

- Cogent/Form
- Sufficiency
- Truth

### Appeal to Authority

e.g. Abortion to save the life of a mother is an irrelevant issue because a former surgeon general, a well-known paediatric surgeon, claimed that in all his years of surgical properties ...

### Equivocation

Shifting the meaning of a given term.

E.g. It is bad to discriminate, but we must discriminate when we are hiring (Does he have enough experience?)

### False Analogy

Giving a wrong, dubious analogy

### False Cause

Assumes a cause-effect relationship between two events because one precedes another.

Meaning x -> y, but actually y -> x. (Think formal proofs)

### False Dilemma

Two and only two alternatives for consideration when other possibilities exist.

E.g. Either you are with us, or you are with them.

### Straw Man

Person creates, and then attacks a distorted version of opposition's argument. Distored version must be worse than it actually is.

# Denotation vs Connotation

Denotation: Proper meaning, noun

Connotation: Imagery or meaning of a word

E.g. Your dress is very aunty (connotation)

# Vagueness vs Ambiguity

Vagueness: Word or phrase is unclear.

Ambiguity: More than one meaning.

# Doublespeak vs Weasel-words

Doublespeak: Language wrapped to hide original meanings.

E.g. He is experienced = He is old

Weasel-words: A word used to avoid stating something forthrightly or directly

E.g. "Virtually foolsproof", "Works like magic"

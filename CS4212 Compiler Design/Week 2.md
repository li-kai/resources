# Parser

The parser takes in tokens from the lexer, and produces the syntax tree for semantics analysis and code generation.

## Types of Parsers

1. Universal
- Can parse any grammar, but inefficient

2. Top-down
- Builds parse trees from root to the leaves

3. Bottom-up
- Builds parse trees from leaves to the root
